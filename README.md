# A library for evaluating trajectory prediction models and making them robust
This repo contains three research projects for evaluating trajectory prediction models: **Social-attack**, which evaluates their social reasoning; **Scene-attack**, which assesses the modelsâ€™ scene understanding; and **Certified**, which introduces a certified performance guarantee.
